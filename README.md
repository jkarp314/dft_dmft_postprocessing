Scripts and examples of postprocessing for DFT and DMFT calculations

I do DFT calculations using Quantum Espresso or Wien2k and DMFT calculations with triqs. Typically (but not always with Wien2k), I use Wannier90 in between.

While those tools are helpful, I often find it useful and necessary to have my own scripts for postprocessing. Here I include some of my scripts and some examples
